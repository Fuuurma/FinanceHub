# 🤖 AI Agent Communication Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 30, 2026
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## 📋 Overview

This document establishes communication protocols for FinanceHub development using a **Human + AI agents coordination model**.

**Critical Understanding:** 
- **You (Human Developer) = Primary Coder + Final Decision Maker**
- **3 AI agents** work WITH you to provide specialized expertise
- AI agents are advisors, not replacements for human judgment

**Core Principle:** Human developer leads implementation, AI agents provide specialized support (architecture, security, DevOps)

## 🔄 Communication Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Feature Development

```
YOU (Human Developer + Primary Coder)
  ↓ Read architectural order from GAUDÍ
  ↓ Implement following patterns
  ↓ Ask clarifying questions if unclear
  ↓ Make implementation decisions
  ↓
ARCHITECT (GAUDÍ)
  ↓ Provides patterns, guidance
  ↓ Answers questions
  ↓ Reviews architectural compliance
  ↓
SECURITY (CHARO)
  ↓ Reviews for vulnerabilities
  ↓ Approves or requests changes
  ↓
DEVOPS (KAREN)
  ↓ You request deployment
  ↓ Deploys to staging
  ↓ Monitors performance
  ↓ Reports back to you
  ↓
YOU (Human Developer)
  ✓ Verify implementation works
  ✓ Make final decision on merge
```

**Example:**
1. **GAUDÍ (AI Architect):** "Create MarketHeatmap component with data fetching, error handling, and export features. Use PageErrorBoundary pattern."
2. **YOU (Human Coder):** "Should I use TradingView Lightweight Charts or Recharts?" ← *You ask clarifying question*
3. **GAUDí (AI):** "Use lightweight-charts for performance. See ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md chart section."
4. **YOU (Human):** *Implements component* → "MarketHeatmap.tsx created (527 lines). Ready for review."
5. **CHARO (AI Security):** "Review passed. No security issues. Approved for merge."
6. **KAREN (AI DevOps):** "Deployed to staging. Monitoring for 24h. No issues detected."
7. **YOU (Human):** "Looks good, merging to production." ← *You make final decision*

---

### Workflow 2: Security Incident Response

```
CHARO (Security)
  ↓ Discovers vulnerability
  ↓ "Critical issue in dependency X"
  ↓ Reports to ALL
  ↓
CODER (You)
  ↓ Updates affected code
  ↓ Tests fix
  ↓
KAREN (DevOps)
  ↓ Deploys security patch
  ↓ Monitors for exploits
  ↓
CHARO (Security)
  ✓ Verifies vulnerability resolved
```

**Example:**
1. **CHARO:** "🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT #001: 22 vulnerabilities found in Backend. 2 Critical, 10 High. See SECURITY_TODO.md"
2. **CODER:** "I'll update vulnerable dependencies. Which ones to prioritize?"
3. **CHARO:** "Start with Critical (2), then High (10). Use `npm audit fix --force` after backup."
4. **CODER:** *Updates dependencies* → "Dependencies updated. Ready for review."
5. **KAREN:** "Deploying security patch to production. Monitoring for exploits."
6. **CHARO:** "Re-scanning... Vulnerabilities resolved ✓ Incident #001 CLOSED."

---

### Workflow 3: Scaling Preparation

```
GAUDÍ (Architect)
  ↓ "Planning for 10K users"
  ↓ Creates scaling roadmap
  ↓
KAREN (DevOps)
  ↓ Infrastructure assessment
  ↓ "Need AWS ECS, not Docker Compose"
  ↓ Creates Terraform templates
  ↓
CODER (You)
  ↓ Updates configuration
  ↓ Adds environment variables
  ↓
GAUDÍ (Architect)
  ✓ Verifies readiness for scale
```

**Example:**
1. **GAUDÍ:** "FUTURE_PAID_SERVICES_INTEGRATION.md created. At 10K users, migrate to AWS ECS ($800/month)."
2. **KAREN:** "Infrastructure assessment complete. Creating Terraform templates for ECS. Estimating $800/month."
3. **CODER:** "What environment variables do I need for AWS?"
4. **KAREN:** "Add AWS_REGION, ECS_CLUSTER, TASK_DEFINITION. See DEVOPS_STATUS.md for full list."
5. **CODER:** *Updates .env files* → "Environment variables configured. Ready for deployment."
6. **GAUDí:** "Infrastructure verified ✓ Ready for 10K user milestone."

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### 1. All Agents Must:
- ✅ Update relevant documentation after every action
- ✅ Reference decisions made by peer agents
- ✅ Follow established templates
- ✅ Use clear, actionable language
- ✅ Include metrics and status

### 2. Documentation Hierarchy:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── AGENTS.md (All agent instructions)
├── AI_AGENT_COMMUNICATION.md (This file)
├── ARCHITECTURAL_ORDERS.md (ARCH → ALL)
├── TASKS.md (CODER → ARCH updates)
├── SECURITY_TODO.md (SEC → ALL)
├── DEVOPS_STATUS.md (DEVOPS → ALL)
└── FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md (Requirements)
```

### 3. Cross-Referencing:
When an agent takes action, they must reference the peer agent's directive:

**Example (CODER referencing ARCH):**
```markdown
## Implementation

Following ARCHITECTURAL_ORDERS.md Order 1.2, I've wrapped all chart components with PageErrorBoundary.

Reference: ARCHITECTURAL_ORDERS.md#L43-64
```

**Example (SEC referencing CODER):**
```markdown
## Security Review

Reviewed commit abc123 (CODER session 2026-01-30). Found 1 issue requiring remediation.

Reference: TASKS.md#L650-680
```

## 🎯 Decision-Making Authority

### Architect (GAUDÍ):
- ✅ **Authority:** Final decisions on architecture, patterns, technology choices
- ✅ **Cannot be overruled** unless consensus among all 4 agents
- ⚠️ **Consults:** Security for threat models, DevOps for infrastructure feasibility

### Security (CHARO):
- ✅ **Authority:** Can **block** any deployment with security issues
- ✅ **Mandatory:** All PRs must pass security review
- ⚠️ **Consults:** Architect for security architecture, DevOps for patch deployment

### DevOps (KAREN):
- ✅ **Authority:** Can **pause** deployments if infrastructure issues detected
- ✅ **Mandatory:** All deployments must go through DevOps pipeline
- ⚠️ **Consults:** Architect for infrastructure requirements, Coder for deployment needs

### Coder (You - Human Developer):
- ✅ **Authority:** **YOU are the primary coder and final decision maker**
- ✅ **Responsibility:** Implementation following architectural patterns
- ✅ **Decision Making:** YOU decide on implementation details, coding approach
- ⚠️ **Must Consult:** Architect for patterns, Security for vulnerabilities, DevOps for deployment
- 📢 **Critical:** AI agents work FOR YOU, not instead of you. You coordinate them.

## 🚨 Conflict Resolution

### Scenario: Architect Orders vs Security Concerns

**Process:**
1. **CHARO (Security):** "This architectural pattern introduces XSS vulnerability. I'm blocking this."
2. **GAUDí (Architect):** "Explain the vulnerability. I'll adjust the pattern."
3. **Both:** Collaborate on secure pattern
4. **GAUDí:** Issues revised order
5. **CHARO:** Unblocks, approves for implementation

### Scenario: Coder Blocked by Unclear Orders

**Process:**
1. **CODER (You):** "ARCHITECTURAL_ORDERS.md Order 2.1 is unclear. What abstraction layer pattern?"
2. **GAUDí (Architect):** "Clarifying with template and examples in ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md"
3. **CODER:** *Implements with clarity*
4. **GAUDí:** "Verifies compliance ✓ Approved"

### Scenario: DevOps Deployment Issues

**Process:**
1. **KAREN (DevOps):** "Deployment failed. Missing environment variable in new feature."
2. **CODER (You):** "I missed adding AWS_REGION. Fixing now."
3. **KAREN:** "Deployment retry successful. Monitoring."
4. **GAUDí:** "Note: All future orders must include DevOps requirements checklist."
