## 📋 TODAY'S ACTION PLAN

### 9:00 AM - Follow-up with Silent Coders

**Message to Send:**
```
Subject: URGENT: Need Response Today - Critical Deadlines

Hi [NAME],

GAUDÍ needs an update on your status. You haven't responded since Jan 29.

CRITICAL DEADLINES:
- [PRIMARY TASK] - Due [DATE/TIME]

If you're blocked, overwhelmed, or need help, please reply immediately.

Please respond by 12:00 PM today with:
1. Current status
2. Any blockers
3. Expected completion time

I'll escalate to GAUDÍ if no response by 12:00 PM.

- ARIA
```

---

### 12:00 PM - Deadline Check

- Verify ScreenerPreset fix completion
- If no response from coders → Escalate to GAUDÍ
- Prepare emergency plan for S-009, S-010, S-011

---

### 5:00 PM - Collect First Reports

| Agent | Report Due | What to Look For |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| GRACE | 5:00 PM | Test plans, coverage baseline |
| MIES | 5:00 PM | Component audit progress |
| HADI | 5:00 PM | WCAG audit progress |

---

## 🎯 ESCALATION DECISION NEEDED

### Option 1: Continue Monitoring
- Send follow-up at 9:00 AM
- Wait for responses
- Risk: Deadlines missed

### Option 2: Direct Intervention
- GAUDÍ sends direct message to silent coders
- Demand response within 2 hours
- Risk: May overwhelm coders

### Option 3: Task Reallocation
- Assign critical tasks (S-009, S-010, S-011) to Auto-coder
- Document why human coders unavailable
- Risk: Auto-coder workload increases

### My Recommendation: **Option 2 with Option 3 Backup**

**Rationale:**
- Coders have been silent 72+ hours
- Critical security tasks due tomorrow
- Auto-coder has proven reliable
- Need decisive action, not more waiting

---

## 📊 AUTO-CODER PERFORMANCE

**Current Status:** 🟢 EXCELLENT

**Today's Accomplishments:**
- ✅ C-025: CSV Bulk Import - COMPLETED
- ✅ C-026: Value-at-Risk Calculator - COMPLETED
- ✅ C-027: Universal Asset Search - COMPLETED
- ✅ C-028: IPO Calendar - COMPLETED
- 🔄 C-029: Level 2 Market Depth - IN PROGRESS

**Recommendation:** Auto-coder can handle S-009, S-010, S-011 if human coders remain unavailable.

---

## 🔄 COMMUNICATION FLOW

### Expected Today:
```
9:00 AM → ARIA sends follow-up to Linus, Guido, Turing
12:00 PM → Deadline check (ScreenerPreset)
5:00 PM → GRACE, MIES, HADI submit first reports
5:00 PM → ARIA compiles summary for GAUDÍ
```

### If No Response by 12:00 PM:
```
12:01 PM → ARIA escalates to GAUDÍ
12:30 PM → GAUDÍ decision on task reallocation
1:00 PM → Auto-coder assigned critical tasks (if needed)
```

## 📈 METRICS TO TRACK

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Coder response rate | 0% | 100% |
| New agents activated | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| New agent reports due today | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| Critical tasks on track | 0/4 | 4/4 |
| ScreenerPreset completion | 0% | 100% |

---

## 💡 KEY OBSERVATIONS

1. **New agents are ready** but waiting for their first reports at 5:00 PM
2. **Human coders are MIA** - 72+ hours of silence
3. **Critical deadlines approaching** - Security tasks due tomorrow
4. **Auto-coder is overperforming** - Completed 4 tasks today
5. **Need GAUDÍ decision** on escalation path

---

## ❓ QUESTIONS FOR GAUDÍ

1. Should I proceed with Option 2 (direct intervention) at 9:00 AM?
2. Should Auto-coder be pre-notified about potential task reallocation?
3. Do you want daily reports from new agents (GRACE, MIES, HADI) forwarded to you?
4. What's the escalation threshold for skipping silent coders entirely?

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Pending Your Decision)

| Time | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| 9:00 AM | Send follow-up to silent coders | ARIA |
| 9:30 AM | Notify Auto-coder about potential additional tasks | ARIA |
| 12:00 PM | Deadline check and escalation | ARIA |
| 5:00 PM | Collect new agent reports | ARIA |
| 5:30 PM | Forward reports to GAUDÍ | ARIA |

**Waiting for your decision on escalation path before 9:00 AM.**
