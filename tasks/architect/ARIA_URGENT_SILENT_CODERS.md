## 🚀 ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Immediate Outreach (Within 1 Hour)

#### Step 1: Send Personalized Messages
Create personalized messages for each coder:

**Linus:**
```
Subject: URGENT: Critical Security Tasks - Your Attention Needed

Hi Linus,

I hope you're doing well. I haven't heard from you in 2+ days and we have
CRITICAL security tasks due this week.

I'm concerned because:
- S-009 (Float Precision) is due Feb 2 - CRITICAL for financial accuracy
- S-011 (Remove Print Statements) is due Feb 2 - CRITICAL security issue
- ScreenerPreset model fix is due Feb 1, 12:00 PM - TOMORROW

Are you blocked on anything? I'm here to help unblock you.

Please reply by 5:00 PM today with:
1. Current status on your tasks
2. Any blockers you're facing
3. When you can start the CRITICAL tasks

Your work is important to us. Let's get you unblocked.

**Guido:**
```
Subject: URGENT: Critical Token Security - Your Attention Needed

Hi Guido,

I haven't heard from you in 2+ days and we have a CRITICAL security task
that needs your expertise.

S-010 (Token Race Conditions) is due Feb 2 - This prevents session hijacking
and replay attacks. It's critical for user security.

I know you're the expert on authentication systems. Can you:
1. Review the task requirements (tasks/security/CHARO_SECURITY_TASKS.md)
2. Start working on the token rotation fix
3. Let me know if you need any help

Are you blocked on anything? I'm here to help.

Please reply by 5:00 PM today with your status.

On behalf of GAUDÍ (Project Lead)
```

**Turing:**
```
Subject: Checking In - Frontend Tasks & Help Needed

Hi Turing,

I haven't heard from you in a few days. I wanted to check in and see how
things are going with your frontend tasks.

You have some great features lined up:
- C-016: Customizable Dashboards
- C-017: Market Heat Map Visualization
- C-038: Options Chain Visualization

Are you making good progress? Any blockers I can help with?

Also, please remember the daily report requirement at 5:00 PM. Even a quick
"still working on X, no blockers" helps keep everyone aligned.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

#### Step 2: Create Helper Documents
Create quick-start guides for each coder:

**For Linus:**
- `tasks/coders/LINUS_QUICK_START.md` with:
  - Priority order of his tasks
  - Commands to run tests
  - Git commit workflow
  - Who to ask for help

**For Guido:**
- `tasks/coders/GUIDO_QUICK_START.md` with:
  - Token rotation implementation guide
  - Test cases for race conditions
  - Code examples
  - Security best practices

**For Turing:**
- `tasks/coders/TURING_QUICK_START.md` with:
  - Frontend task priority order
  - Component templates
  - Testing guide
  - UI/UX resources

---

### Phase 2: Follow-Up (24 Hours Later)

#### If No Response Within 24 Hours:
1. **Send follow-up message** (more urgent but still supportive)
2. **CC GAUDÍ** on the message
3. **Schedule 1:1 video call** to unblock
4. **Consider reassigning critical tasks** if necessary

#### Template:
```
Subject: FOLLOW-UP: Urgent Tasks Need Your Input

Hi [Coder Name],

I sent a message yesterday but haven't heard back. I'm getting worried
because we have CRITICAL deadlines approaching.

GAUDÍ is asking for status updates. Can you please reply by end of day today?

If you're overwhelmed or stuck, let me know. We can:
- Adjust your workload
- Pair you with another coder
- Extend deadlines if needed
- Provide more detailed guidance

Your success matters to us. Please reach out.

- ARIA
CC: GAUDÍ
```

### Phase 3: Escalation (48 Hours Later)

#### If Still No Response:
1. **Schedule emergency meeting** with GAUDÍ
2. **Discuss workload issues**
3. **Consider resource reallocation**
4. **Update project timeline** if needed

## 🎓 COMMUNICATION STRATEGY

### Tone
- **Supportive** - "I'm here to help"
- **Concerned** - "I haven't heard from you"
