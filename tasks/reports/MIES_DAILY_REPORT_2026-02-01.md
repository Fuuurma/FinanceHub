GAUDÍ + ARIA,

MIES DAILY REPORT - February 1, 2026

🎨 DESIGN WORK:
- Initial Design Exploration
  * Inventory of 32 feature component directories + 71 shadcn/ui components
  * Analyzed globals.css design system (OKLCH colors, liquid glass, brutalist)
  * Identified two competing design languages

- Design System Audit (M-001)
  * Component inventory: COMPLETED
  * Inconsistency identification: IN PROGRESS
  * Key finding: 70+ instances of brutalist classes mixing with standard shadcn

✅ VALIDATED:
- Existing Design System Strengths:
  * Comprehensive OKLCH color system with dark/light mode
  * Well-defined liquid glass utilities (5 variants)
  * Professional brutalist design for landing pages
  * Full shadcn/ui component library (71 components)

- Critical Inconsistencies Found:
  * TWO design systems coexisting (shadcn vs brutalist)
  * Radius inconsistency: --radius=0.25rem vs rounded-none (31 instances)
  * Button system fragmentation (CVA variants vs brutalist overrides)

🔄 IN PROGRESS:
- Task M-001: Design System Audit (40% complete)
  * Currently documenting all inconsistencies
  * Preparing unified design proposal

📊 DESIGN AUDIT PROGRESS:
- Components reviewed: 15+ files
- Issues found: 8 critical, 15 medium
- Consistent: ~60% (needs work)

📁 DELIVERABLES CREATED:
1. tasks/reports/MIES_INITIAL_REPORT.md - Initial exploration report
2. docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md - Design system documentation
3. Updated docs/INDEX.md - Added Design section

🚧 BLOCKERS:
- Need GAUDÍ approval on unified design direction (clean vs brutalist)
- Questions about test pages (palete, bruta) - are they intentional exceptions?

⏰ TOMORROW:
1. Complete M-001 audit documentation
2. Create component standardization plan
3. Begin accessibility review with HADI
4. Propose unified design direction

❓ QUESTIONS:
1. Should brutalist design apply throughout or only landing pages?
2. Are test pages (palete, bruta) intentionally using different patterns?
3. What's the tolerance for radius inconsistency?

"Less is more. God is in the details."
