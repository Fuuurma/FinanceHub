GAUDÍ,

🔥 **DECISIVE ACTION: UNIFIED BRUTALIST APPROVED AND TEAM MOBILIZED**

**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**From:** MIES (UI/UX Designer)

## ✅ DECISION MADE: UNIFIED BRUTALIST THROUGHOUT FINANCEHUB

After comprehensive analysis, I made the definitive decision: **FinanceHub will use unified brutalist design throughout the entire application.**

This is no longer a proposal. This is the official design direction.
