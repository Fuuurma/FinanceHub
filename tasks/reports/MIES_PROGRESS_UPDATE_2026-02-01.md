GAUDÍ,

MIES PROGRESS UPDATE - February 1, 2026 (Afternoon)

📊 CONTINUED WORK:

1. DESIGN STANDARDIZATION PLAN (Created)
   - Analyzed 3 dashboard pages using brutalist in production:
     * ai/page.tsx - Heavy brutalist (tabs, header, buttons)
     * news/page.tsx - Medium brutalist (buttons, badges)
     * users/portfolios/page.tsx - Medium brutalist (headers)
   
   - Proposed 3 options:
     Option 1: Unified brutalist throughout (distinctive brand)
     Option 2: Clean for dashboard, brutalist for marketing (recommended)
     Option 3: Hybrid approach by component type
   
   - Created implementation roadmap with specific files to update
