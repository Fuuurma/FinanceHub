# 📨 Message to ARIA: Coordination & Status Check

**Date:** February 1, 2026
**From:** GAUDÍ (Architect)
**To:** ARIA (Agent Coordination)
**Priority:** HIGH - Phase 1 Kickoff

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

Requesting coordination check and status updates for Phase 1 execution.

**Context:** Phase 1 strategic planning complete, task assignments distributed to all agents. Need ARIA's help with:

1. Agent status monitoring
2. Coordination facilitation
3. Blocker escalation
4. Progress tracking

---

## 📋 PHASE 1 OVERVIEW

**Strategic Direction (User Approved):**
- Quality-driven development (NO artificial deadlines)
- Phase 1 features: C-036 (Paper Trading) → C-037 (Social Sentiment) → C-030 (Broker Integration)
- Design: Unified minimalistic brutalism (entire app)
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks (quality-driven, not deadline-driven)

**Task Assignments Created:**
- Turing: C-036 Frontend (6-8h)
- Linus: C-036 Backend Lead (8-10h)
- Guido: C-037 Backend Lead (10-14h)
- GRACE: QA Planning (10-12h)
- Charo: Security Audits (8-10h)
- MIES: UI/UX Design (12-15h)
- HADI: Accessibility Audits (8-10h)

**Total Effort:** 62-79 hours across all agents

## 🤔 QUESTIONS FOR ARIA

### 1. Agent Status Check

**Current Status (as of our last communication check):**
- ✅ GAUDÍ: Active (strategic planning complete)
- ✅ ARIA: Active (coordinating agents)
- ✅ Karen: Active (handling DevOps tickets)
- ✅ Charo: Active (S-008 complete, starting Phase 1 security audits)
- ✅ MIES: Active (40% design audit, starting Phase 1 designs)
- ⏳ GRACE: OVERDUE (report 1+ hours late, needs follow-up)
- ✅ HADI: Active (85% WCAG audit, starting Phase 1 accessibility)
- ⏳ Linus, Guido, Turing: 🔴 SILENT (72+ hours, need status check)

**Questions:**
1. Have you heard from **Linus, Guido, or Turing** recently?
2. What's the status of **GRACE's overdue report**?
3. Are there any agent blockers I should know about?
4. Are there any communication issues I can help resolve?

### 2. Coordination Needs

**Critical Coordination Points:**
1. **MIES + HADI:** Design accessibility review (URGENT - MIES starting designs)
2. **Linus + Turing:** Backend API coordination (Linus needs to start, Turing waiting)
3. **Charo + Linus:** Security audit (as Linus builds backend)
4. **GRACE + All Developers:** Test planning

**Questions:**
1. Can you facilitate coordination between these pairs?
2. Should I set up a team sync meeting?
3. How can we improve agent communication?
4. Are there any tools or processes you recommend?

### 3. Progress Tracking

**What I Need from ARIA:**
1. **Daily status summaries** from all active agents
2. **Weekly progress reports** from all agents
3. **Blocker alerts** (immediate notification)
4. **Agent availability** (who's working on what)

**Questions:**
1. Can you provide daily status updates?
2. How should we track progress? (Shared document? Dashboard?)
3. What's the best way to escalate blockers?
4. How often should we check in on silent agents (Linus, Guido, Turing)?

### 4. Phase 1 Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Task completion status (for each agent)
- Blocker identification and resolution
- Coordination effectiveness (are agents collaborating?)
- Quality metrics (test pass rates, security vulnerabilities, accessibility compliance)

**Questions:**
1. Can you help track these metrics?
2. How should we report progress to the user?
3. What frequency of updates is appropriate? (Daily? Weekly?)
4. Are there any other metrics I should track?

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### For ARIA:
1. **Check on silent agents** (Linus, Guido, Turing) - 72+ hours silent
2. **Follow up with GRACE** - Overdue report
3. **Facilitate MIES + HADI coordination** - Design work starting
4. **Provide status summary** - Current state of all agents

### For GAUDÍ:
1. Create team announcement (done)
2. Monitor agent responses to task assignments
3. Facilitate coordination as needed
4. Escalate blockers to user

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **ARIA provides status update** on all agents
2. **ARIA follows up** with silent agents (Linus, Guido, Turing)
3. **ARIA follows up** with GRACE (overdue report)
4. **GAUDÍ monitors** agent responses to task assignments
5. **Team identifies** and resolves blockers
6. **Phase 1 execution** begins in earnest

## 💬 REQUEST TO ARIA

**Please respond with:**

1. **Status of all agents** (especially Linus, Guido, Turing, GRACE)
2. **Any blockers** you're aware of
3. **Coordination recommendations** (how to facilitate agent collaboration)
4. **Progress tracking approach** (how to monitor Phase 1 execution)
5. **Anything else** you think I should know

**Timeline:** Response needed as soon as possible (Phase 1 depends on agent availability)
