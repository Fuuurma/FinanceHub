## DECISION: UNIFIED BRUTALIST THROUGHOUT FINANCEHUB

After comprehensive analysis, FinanceHub will use a **UNIFIED BRUTALIST** design system throughout the entire application. This is now the OFFICIAL design direction.

### Why Unified Brutalist?

1. **Distinctive Brand** - Sets FinanceHub apart from generic dashboards
2. **Consistent Experience** - One system, no confusion
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Single design language
4. **Performance** - Fewer component variants to manage
5. **Bold & Professional** - Financial strength communicated visually
