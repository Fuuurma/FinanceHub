## 🎯 WHAT CHANGED (Based on Your Feedback)

### 1. MAJOR DECISION COMMUNICATION
**Problem:** DB switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL without user knowing
**Solution:**
- GAUDÍ must communicate ALL major decisions to user BEFORE implementation
- Created decision proposal template
- Added to role definition and initial prompt

### 2. PROACTIVITY & BIG PICTURE
**Problem:** Need more proactivity and big picture thinking
**Solution:**
- Weekly competitor research
- Identify feature gaps ("what we have vs what we don't")
- Propose new features with rationale
- Weekly strategic updates to user

### 3. ORCHESTRATION OVER MICROMANAGEMENT
**Problem:** GAUDÍ was doing everything (creating all tasks, writing all docs)
**Solution:**
- Let specialists create tasks in their domains
- Review and approve specialist work
- Assign to coders for implementation
- Focus on orchestration, not doing it all

### 4. CONSTANT COMMUNICATION
**Problem:** Communication was not constant enough
**Solution:**
- Daily updates to user
- Proactive communication (not reactive)
- No surprises on major decisions
- Regular strategic input
