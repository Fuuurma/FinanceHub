## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Communication Overload
**Risk:** Too many daily reports for GAUDÍ to review
**Solution:** ARIA summarizes all reports into one daily brief

#### 2. Role Confusion
**Risk:** Unclear boundaries between MIES (Design) and HADI (Accessibility)
**Solution:** Clear role definitions, collaborative projects documented

#### 3. Resource Conflict
**Risk:** GRACE blocked waiting for coder code (S-009, S-010, S-011)
**Solution:** GRACE can write test skeleton, review other tests, create guidelines while waiting

#### 4. Integration Friction
**Risk:** New agents conflicting with existing workflows
**Solution:** ARIA facilitates introductions, establishes protocols

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS (IMMEDIATE)

1. **[ ] Create initial prompts** (GRACE, MIES, HADI)
2. **[ ] Update TASK_TRACKER.md** with new sections
3. **[ ] Send welcome messages** to all 3 agents
4. **[ ] Create team roster** document
5. **[ ] Establish reporting** protocol
6. **[ ] Monitor first daily reports** (tomorrow 5:00 PM)
