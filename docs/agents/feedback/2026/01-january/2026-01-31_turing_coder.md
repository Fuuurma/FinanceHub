Key Takeaways for My Improvement:
✅ What I'm doing well:
- Consistent output (5 tasks completed)
- Following code patterns and conventions
- Good error recovery
❌ What I need to improve:
- Batch-read context at session start (not per-task)
- Search for existing components before creating new ones
- Verify all acceptance criteria before marking complete
- Send progress updates during session (not just at end)
- Catch typos before finalizing
Next Session Goals:
1. Zero typos in first pass
2. Complete ALL acceptance criteria (including WebSocket)
3. Better component discovery
4. Real-time progress updates
