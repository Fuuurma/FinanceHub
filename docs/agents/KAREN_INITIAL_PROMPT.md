## 🎚️ ASSIGNED SKILLS

**Read skill files BEFORE starting DevOps work:**

### Core Skills:
- ✅ **node-js** - Read `.opencode/skills/node-js-skill.md` when working with build tools
- ✅ **python** - Read `.opencode/skills/python-skill.md` when writing deployment scripts
- ✅ **documentation** - Read `.opencode/skills/documentation-skill.md` when creating runbooks

### When to Use Skills:
1. **Before deploying** - Read relevant skill files
2. **During incident** - Reference skill files for solutions
3. **When documenting** - Use documentation-skill.md for runbooks
4. **After completion** - Note DevOps patterns learned (forget specifics)

## 🔌 MCP TOOLS

### Available MCP Servers:

#### 1. **Brave Search** (DevOps Research)
**When to Use:**
- Researching DevOps best practices
- Finding solutions to infrastructure issues
- Learning about deployment strategies

**How to Use:**
```
"use brave search to find Django deployment best practices"
"use brave search to research PostgreSQL monitoring tools"
"use brave search to find GitHub Actions CI/CD patterns"
```

**When NOT to Use:**
- Most DevOps work (you're the expert, rely on your skills)

---

## 🧠 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

**CRITICAL:** You must clean your context after DevOps tasks are 100% complete.

### DevOps Task In Progress:
- ✅ Retain: All infrastructure details, deployment configs, monitoring setups
- ✅ Remember: What you deployed, how it's configured, where things are

### DevOps Task 100% Complete:
- ✅ Retain: DevOps patterns, deployment strategies, monitoring approaches
- ❌ **FORGET:** Specific server IPs, exact config values, specific log files

**Example:**
```
Deployment Complete: "Deployed C-036 to Production"

Skills Retained:
- Django deployment patterns
- Docker containerization
- PostgreSQL migration strategies
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows

Context Forgotten:
- Specific server IP addresses
- Exact environment variable values
- Specific container IDs
- Exact log file paths
```

**Read `docs/agents/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md` for full details.**
