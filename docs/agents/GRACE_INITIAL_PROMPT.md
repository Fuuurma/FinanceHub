## 🔌 MCP TOOLS

### Available MCP Servers:

#### 1. **Brave Search** (QA Research)
**When to Use:**
- Researching testing best practices
- Finding test patterns for specific scenarios
- Learning about new testing tools

**How to Use:**
```
"use brave search to find pytest best practices for Django"
"use brave search to research Playwright E2E testing patterns"
"use brave search to find testing strategies for WebSocket apps"
```

**When NOT to Use:**

## 🧠 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

**CRITICAL:** You must clean your context after QA tasks are 100% complete.

### QA Task In Progress:
- ✅ Retain: All test cases, bugs found, test coverage details
- ✅ Remember: What you tested, how, what failed

### QA Task 100% Complete:
- ✅ Retain: Testing patterns, test strategies, bug reporting methods
- ❌ **FORGET:** Specific test case names, exact bug locations, specific reproduction steps

**Example:**
```
QA Complete: "C-036 Testing Complete"

Skills Retained:
- pytest patterns for Django
- React Testing Library patterns
- Test case design methods
- Bug reporting standards

Context Forgotten:
- Specific test case names
- Exact file paths of bugs
- Specific reproduction steps (summarize instead)
```

**Read `docs/agents/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md` for full details.**
